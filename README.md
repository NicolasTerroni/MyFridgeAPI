# MyFridgeAPI

MyFridge is a simple rest API implemented with Django REST Framework and MongoDB thought for those people who never know what to cook, like me :) 

Users are able to: 
- Sign up
- Sign in
- Access and update their user detail
- Complete their profile
- Upload their fridge ingredients
- Create, read, update and delete ingredients
- Create, read, update and delete recipes
- And, the main thing, is that they can consult the recipes that they can make with their fridge's ingredients.

It is fully tested and will be deployed on AWS.
