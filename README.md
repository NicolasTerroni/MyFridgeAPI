# MyFridgeAPI

MyFridge is a simple rest API implemented with Django REST Framework and MongoDB thought for those people who never know what to cook, like me :) 


## Users are able to: 

* Sign up
* Sign in
* Access and update their user detail
* Complete their profile
* Upload their fridge ingredients
* Create, read, update and delete ingredients
* Create, read, update and delete recipes
* And, the main thing, is that **they can consult the recipes that they can make with their fridge's ingredients.**


## Running Locally

1. Must have Python 3 & [MongoDB (Community Server)][1] installed and running. If you donÂ´t here is the [MongoDB Install Guide][2], to install mongo locally.
1. Clone this repository and access it through the command line.
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
1. Go into your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv/Scripts/activate` in Windows)
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Setup Database (in the mongo shell)
    1. Create the database: `use my-fridge;`
    1. Create DB user with privilages on all dbs:
			db.createUser(
			{	user: "my-fridge-admin",
			pwd: "password",
			roles:[{role: "userAdminAnyDatabase" , db:"admin"}]})

1. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
